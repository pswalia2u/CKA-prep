kubectl rollout status deployment/<deployment-name>

kubectl rollout history deployment/<deployment-name>

kubectl rollout undo deployment/<deployment-name>

Deployment strategy for updates:
1. Recreate (delete all pods and then spin up new pods- results in downtime)

2. Rolling (it is default)(deletes a pod and spins a new one. One by one- Downtime doesn't occur)

#kubectl get priorityclass
Priority classes are not lined to any namespace. They are global.
If no priorityclass is assigned to a pod by default it will be 0.

Phases of pod scheduling:
1. Scheduling Queue- Pods are arraged according to priority class attached to them.(Sorting)

2. Filtering - Nodes that do not match the resource requirement of the pod are filtered out.

3. Scoring of nodes: Nodes are scored based on the resources that will be left after provisioning of pod. More resources left ==> more score

4. Binding pod to node
